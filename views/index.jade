				p Um, this is awkward&hellip; all navigation (and most of the functionality) on this site relies on JavaScript, a programming language that helps add interactivity to web sites. So I can't really do anything until you enable it. If you don't know how to enable JavaScript, look <a href="http://www.activatejavascript.org">here</a>.

					p Here's how it is: Earth got used up, so we terraformed a whole new galaxy of Earths, some rich and flush with the new technologies, some not so much. Central Planets, them was formed the Alliance, waged war to bring everyone under their rule; a few idiots tried to fight it, among them myself. I'm Malcolm Reynolds, captain of Serenity. Got a good crew: fighters, pilot, mechanic. We even picked up a preacher, and a bona fide companion. There's a doctor, too, took his genius sister out of some Alliance camp, so they're keeping a low profile. You got a job, we can do it, don't much care what it is.

					p Look for the Union Label when you are buying a coat, dress, or blouse. Remember, somewhere our union's sewing, our wages going to feed the kids, and run the house. We work hard, but who's complaining. Thanks to the I.L.G. we're paying our way. So always look for the Union Label. It means we're able to make it in the U.S.A.!
